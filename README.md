# The Leader!

### Extending your TODOs

- [ ] In *__template-parts/content.php__*, make new file of content-single.php for single post and remove all code of single post from content.php
- [ ] In *__template-parts/content.php__*, make whole post wraps in <a> tag, right after the <article> tag.
- [ ] Make a new file as named *postslist.php* on *template-parts* folder and call that file in *index.php*
- [ ] The *postslist.php* file contains the main loop and will call all formats of posts by using switch case. [See this example](https://image.ibb.co/cSkT2a/Capture.png)
- [ ] Make a folder *postformats* that will contain all formats you specified in *postslist.php*
